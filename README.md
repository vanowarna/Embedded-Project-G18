#### Introduction
In Industrial applications, transmitting and receiving signals with higher precision and accuracy is the prime goal. For the embedded system project, we have designed a model to approach this using a laser beam. The system can transmit 4-bit simplex signals efficiently with a low-cost setup and display the received signal. To approach this, a transmitter and a receiver will be designed separately. For demonstration purposes, the transmitter is input with a 4-bit digital signal and the receiver displays the relevant signal. We aim to achieve this goal using two PIC16F84A microcontrollers for the hardware and Assembly language for scripting
